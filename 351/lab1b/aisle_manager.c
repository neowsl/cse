 * Overview
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  This is a program to keep track of the items in a small aisle of a store.
 *
 *  A store's aisle is represented by a 64-bit long integer, which is broken
 *  into 4 16-bit sections representing one type of item each. Note that since
 *  a section is 16-bits, it fits nicely into C's short datatype.
 *
 *  Aisle Layout:
 *
 *    Within an aisle, sections are indexed starting with the least-significant
 *    section being at index 0 and continuing up until one less than the number
 *    of sections.
 *
 *    Example aisle:
 *
 *                MSB                                                       LSB
 *                  +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
 *                  |  Section 3  |  Section 2  |  Section 1  |  Section 0  |
 *                  +-------------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
 *                  |             |             |             |             |
 *      bit offset: 64            48            32            16            0
 *
 *  Section Layout:
 *
 *    A section in an aisle is broken into 2 parts. The 6 most significant bits
 *    represent a unique identifier for the type of item stored in that
 *    section. The rest of the bits in a section (10 least significant)
 *    indicate individual spaces for items in that section. For each of the 10
 *    bits/spaces, a 1 indicates that an item of the section's type is stored
 *    there and a 0 indicates that the space is empty.
 *
 *    Example aisle section: 0x651A
 *
 *                MSB                               LSB
 *                  +-----------+-------------------+
 *                  |0 1 1 0 0 1|0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0|
 *                  +-----------+-------------------+
 *                  | item id   | section spaces    |
 *      bit offset: 16          10                  0
 *
 *      In this example, the item id is 0b011001, and there are currently 4
 *      items stored in the section (at bit offsets 8, 4, 3, and 1) and 6
 *      vacant spaces.
